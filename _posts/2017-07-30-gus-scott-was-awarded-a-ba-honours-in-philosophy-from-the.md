I was awarded a BA (Honours) in Philosophy from the University of London. 

I have been working in both the public and private sectors for 35 years and have developed a passion for philosophy and public discussion of both ancient and modern topics.

My blogs on warfare and ethics have been referenced more than 4,000 times in papers via Academia.edu.

I offer an online Skype or Facetime 'philosophy-chat' service and an 'emergency essay' writing or proofreading service for those of us, who, with our busy lives, need that little extra help from time to time. 

I am extremely well read and have taken three speed-reading courses. I am able to absorb vast quantities of information and concepts in a short time. I have impeccable spelling, grammar and attention to detail.

Prices are insanely affordable for 15 minutes online chat about thought experiments and a little more to proofread an essay. Writing your essay for you from scratch will cost a bit more and if full references are needed and if time critical, i.e. needed by the professor tomorrow morning! 

Live well. Be well and enjoy your journey.
